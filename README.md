## History 
Since 2013-06-08, mfeeg has been on https://sourceforge.net/projects/mfeeg/. A brief description of mfeeg there （I would like to copy it right as it was）is as below:

"

The aim of mfeeg is not to provide a graphic-user-interface (mfeeg is command line based) and a comprehensive toolbox with a huge body, 
but to discuss (with you) about various problems met in eeg analysis using the "language" of short m files. 
Each file in mfeeg is very short and easy to read, thus making it clear that how a given algorithm is implemented.

What's mfeeg

mfeeg is a package composed of short m files(matlab program) for electroencephalography (EEG) analysis.

The aim of mfeeg is not to provide a graphical-user-interface (mfeeg is command line based) and a comprehensive toolbox with a huge body, 
but to discuss (with you) about various problems met in eeg analysis using the "language" of short m files.

mfeeg is distributed under GPL. I hope it will be useful to you and contribute to the scientific open source society. 
Welcome to discuss with me, find bugs, and propose improvements via rwfwuwx@gmail.com.

What mfeeg can do

I would refer the readers to our published papers using mfeeg as listed below.

What mfeeg can't do

1 pca & ica

Which can be done by eeglab, or commercial software neuroscan.

2 source analysis

Which can be done by the plugin of eeglab, spm, or commercial software curry.

## From 2024
Updates of mfeeg are now maintained here. (The sourceforge site version is obsolete).

The biggest change, in terms of both development and usage, is that mfeeg now serves as a base library for 11buddy-&-I (https://github.com/rwfwuwx/11buddy-and-I). 

In other words, while mfeeg still can run independently, the recommandation is to use mfeeg as an integrated part of 11buddy-&-I, particularly Andy; for end-to-end, and, no-coding EEG anaysis experience.
